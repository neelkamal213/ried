    <h2>What is RIED</h2>
    <p>RIED is a mission-oriented framework focused on translating academic research, patents, prototypes, and grassroots innovations into scalable enterprises and socio-economic outcomes. By bridging the gap between ideas and implementation, RIED helps unlock India's vast potential in science, technology, and entrepreneurship.</p>
    <p>RIED operates at the intersection of academia, innovation ecosystems, startups, rural and semi-urban institutions, industry, and public systems, ensuring that promising ideas move meaningfully from labs and papers to markets and people. Our holistic approach fosters collaboration and accelerates the commercialization process for long-term benefits.</p>

    <h2>Why RIED Exists</h2>
    <p>India produces vast intellectual capital and grassroots innovation. Yet a large proportion remains unrealized—never becoming companies, solutions, or livelihoods. This results in missed opportunities for economic growth, job creation, and societal advancement in both urban and rural areas.</p>
    <p>The gap is not intent or intelligence. The gap lies in:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
      <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle"></i> research translation,</li>
      <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle"></i> entrepreneurship development,</li>
      <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle"></i> market integration, and</li>
      <li><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle"></i> scale readiness,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>particularly within semi-urban and rural academic ecosystems. These regions often face resource constraints, limited networks, and challenges in navigating complex markets, leading to innovative ideas stalling at early stages.</p>
    <p>RIED exists to bridge this gap by building structured, outcome-driven pathways from Discovery → Enterprise → Development. We provide the tools, mentorship, and connections needed to transform potential into progress, creating a more inclusive innovation landscape across India.</p>
